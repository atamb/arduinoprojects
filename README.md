# arduinoprojects

There are some arduino codes for beginner and intermediate levels. Also you can see the materials needed for each project. 


1-)Projects with leds:


1a-)knightrider.ino 

Requires: 1xArduinoBoard(ArduinoUno,ArduinoNG,ArduinoMega etc.), 1xBreadboard, 4xLED, 3x330ohm resistor, 9x male to male jumper cable.  

Project: In this project, we will create an LED array that allows the LEDs to turn on/off in one direction in sequence, and when it comes to the last LED, it performs this operation in the opposite direction. 

1b-)rgb_led_animation.ino

Requires: 1xArduinoBoard(ArduinoUno,ArduinoNG,ArduinoMega etc.), 1xBreadboard, 1xRGB LED, 3x330ohm resistor, 4x male to male jumper cable.

Project: The aim of this project is to see how different colors are obtained in RGB LEDs with different frequency and voltage values, and also to design an animation by sending these colors to the LED in a sequence. 

1c-)basic_ledbutton_circuit.ino

Requires: 1xArduinoBoard(ArduinoUno,ArduinoNG,ArduinoMega etc.), 1xBreadboard, 1xLED, 1x10kohm resistor, 1x330ohm resistor, 5x male to male jumper cable.

Project: In this project, a code has been written to turn the LED on and off by turning the active button on and off.

1d-)rgb_led_showing_answer.ino

Requires: 1xArduinoBoard(ArduinoUno,ArduinoNG,ArduinoMega etc.), 1xBreadboard, 1xRGB LED, 3x330ohm resistor, 4x male to male jumper cable.

Project: Generally, arduino is not used for receiving entries in string type but with this project, the working principle of rgb LEDs can be better understood. In the code there is a question. If responder gives the correct answer the rgb LED lights green, If he/she gives the wrong answer the rgb LED lights red.


1e-)distancemeter_with_rgb_led.ino:

Requires: 1xArduinoBoard(ArduinoUno,ArduinoNG,ArduinoMega etc.), 1xBreadboard,  1xRGB LED, 1x ultrasonic sensor(HC-SR04), 3x330ohm resistor, 7x male to male jumper cable.

Project: In this project, we will measure the distance with ultrasonic sensor and show the distance interval with rgb led. If distance measured less than 25cm, rgb led lights red. If distance measured between 25cm and 45 cm, rgb led lights blue and if distance measured greater than 45, the rgb led lights green.


2-)measuring_temperature_with_dht.ino:

Requires: 1xArduinoBoard(ArduinoUno,ArduinoNG,ArduinoMega etc.), 1xBreadboard, 1x dht22, 3x male to male jumper cable.

Project: With this code you can measure the temperature and humidity. They will appear on the screen after the running code.

3-)potentiometer.ino:

Requires: 1xArduinoBoard(ArduinoUno,ArduinoNG,ArduinoMega etc.), 1xBreadboard, 1x potentiometer, 3x male to male jumper cable.

Project: Potentiometer is a circuit element used to change the voltage in the circuit. In this code, I set up a circuit that will change the voltage value using a potentiometer and measure the voltage value every 0.4 seconds.
