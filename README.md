# arduinoprojects

There are some arduino codes for beginner and intermediate levels. Also you can see the materials needed for each project. 


Projects with leds:


1-)knightrider.io 

Requires: 1xArduinoBoard(ArduinoUno,ArduinoNG,ArduinoMega etc.), 1xBreadboard, 4xLED, 3x330ohm resistor, 9x male to male jumper cable.  

Project: In this project, we will create an LED array that allows the LEDs to turn on/off in one direction in sequence, and when it comes to the last LED, it performs this operation in the opposite direction.

2-)rgb_led_animation.io

Requires: 1xArduinoBoard(ArduinoUno,ArduinoNG,ArduinoMega etc.), 1xBreadboard, 1xRGB LED, 3x330ohm resistor, 4x male to male jumper cable.

Project: The aim of this project is to see how different colors are obtained in RGB LEDs with different frequency and voltage values, and also to design an animation by sending these colors to the LED in a sequence.
