1-)knightrider.io 

Requires: 1xArduinoUnoR3, 1xBreadboard, 4xLED, 3x330ohm resistor, 9x male to male jumper cable.  

Project: In this project, we will create an LED array that allows the LEDs to turn on/off in one direction in sequence, and when it comes to the last LED, it performs this operation in the opposite direction.
